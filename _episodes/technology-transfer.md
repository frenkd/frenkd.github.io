In this special live episode of the ASEF Podcast, recorded at Dragon Days in Celje, we hosted Michael Stucky - a partner at Serpentine Ventures, visiting from Zurich, Switzerland, and Jure Vindišar - Head of Technology Transfer at the National Institute of Biology in Slovenia.

We delved into the concept of technology transfer, which is all about creating real-world impact from cutting-edge research. This encompasses things like university spin-outs and licensing intellectual property for the purpose of bringing scientific innovations to the market. Tune in to hear inspiring stories of deep-tech entrepreneurship from Slovenia and Switzerland, the importance of innovation clusters, insights from Mario Draghi's recent report on the EU's competitiveness, and a broader perspective on what it takes to build a thriving technology transfer ecosystem.

The conversation was conducted by ASEF Junior Fellow Frenk Dragar.
