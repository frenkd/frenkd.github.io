In this episode we talk about University Spin-Outs. How is it different from a "classic" start-up? What is the process of founding a university spin-out in Slovenia?

We look at the journey of two such companies: prof. Tomaž Skrbinšek presents DIVJALabs, where they work on molecular genetics and bioinformatics for biodiversity conservation and research, while Blaž Zoubek, PhD, tells us about SPEKTRAL - the structural engineering and consulting company, both spin-outs from the University of Ljubljana.
