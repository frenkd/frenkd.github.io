As part of the **AI Lightning Round** at the Kiss the Future Meetup — powered by SLO AI — I shared hands-on lessons from building and shipping production-grade LLM systems in education. Fast. Focused. Practical.

## Event Details

**Date:** Tuesday, February 17, 2026  
**Location:** Evropska kuća kulture i nacionalnih manjina, Sarajevo  
**Event:** Kiss the Future Meetup — AI Lightning Round (powered by SLO AI)

## Talk Abstract

**Title:** Lessons from LLM-Based Grading and Voice-Based Simulation Systems in EdTech

What really happens when LLMs move from demo to production?

At Trivial Group, we design and deliver large-scale LLM grading, evaluation, and simulation platforms that power automated feedback systems in education and interactive, dialogue-based simulators used for training and assessment. In this talk, I shared hands-on lessons from deploying these systems in real EdTech products, tackling challenges like:

- Grader bias and tutor disagreement
- Noisy and incomplete data
- Designing automated feedback that is fair, constructive, and useful
- Building evaluation pipelines you can actually trust

A practical look at architecture, evaluation, and feedback design for teams building reliable, interactive AI systems at scale.

## About the AI Lightning Round

Fast. Focused. Practical. Short talks from builders deploying AI where it actually runs — part of the Kiss the Future Meetup, organized in partnership with SLO AI.

## Speaker Bio

**Frenk Dragar** is the CEO and Co-founder of Trivial Group and a Founding Member of SLO AI. He builds production-grade AI systems that ship — specializing in LLM grading, evaluation, and simulation platforms for education and enterprise.
