**Time:** 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM CEST (Doors at 5:45 PM)  
**Location:** Austria Trend Hotel Ljubljana, Dunajska cesta 154, 1000 Ljubljana  
**Duration:** 3 hours

## About This Event

His talk, "From Autonomous Agents to Predictive Models: Building the Future of AI", explored how autonomous AI agents are transforming industries and scientific research by integrating execution with predictive modeling. This event was ideal for engineers, researchers, and investors interested in the future of AI and intelligent systems.

### Speaker

**Jure Leskovec** is a renowned expert in machine learning and data mining, particularly known for his work on large-scale networks and graph neural networks. As a professor at Stanford University and former Chief Scientist at Pinterest, he has been at the forefront of developing AI systems that can understand and predict complex patterns in data.

### Talk Abstract

AI agents are poised to transform how we solve complex, real-world problems by autonomously executing tasks across scientific and industrial domains. But true autonomy requires more than just action—it requires decision-making. For agents to make meaningful decisions, they must interpret data, build models, and anticipate the consequences of their actions.

This talk explored the key components needed to build such intelligent systems, from agents that can operate across diverse tools and environments to foundational models that reason over private, structured data. By combining execution and prediction, we unlock the potential for scalable, intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and drive discovery.

### Agenda

18:00 - 19:00 - From Autonomous Agents to Predictive Models: Building the Future of AI  
19:00 - 21:00 - Networking and discussions

This event was organized by Slovenia AI Meetup and represents our commitment to bringing world-class AI expertise to Slovenia's growing tech community.
