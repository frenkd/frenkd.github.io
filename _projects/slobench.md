# SloBENCH

SloBENCH is an evaluation platform for benchmarking the development of Slovene natural language processing technologies. I implemented this system as part of my BSc Thesis, contributing to the Clarin.si & CJVT initiatives.

## Project Highlights

- Created a platform where evaluation data labels remain private to ensure fair model testing
- Implemented submission limitations to prevent overfitting while providing public evaluation scripts
- Designed and built up to ten different NLP leaderboards for the Slovene language
- Supported the open-source development of NLP systems for a low-resource language

## Impact

The platform was developed as one of Clarin.si's 2021 projects and was proposed by Slavko Žitnik, Marko Robnik-Šikonja, and Simon Krek. It has become an important resource for advancing and standardizing the evaluation of Slovene language technologies and promoting open science practices in the NLP community.
