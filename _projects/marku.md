# MarkU - Automatic Marketing

MarkU is an innovative automated content marketing solution that streamlines marketing efforts using AI-driven technology. Our team won the lablab.ai Autonomous GPT Agents Hackathon with this project and were included in their accelerator program.

## Project Highlights

- **AI-Powered Content Creation**: Leveraged Langchain with OpenAI GPT-3.5 to conduct in-depth market analysis, competitor assessments, and identify unique selling points
- **Automated Research**: Integrated with Serper for automatic Google searches to provide unparalleled market research capabilities
- **Social Media Strategy**: Generated contextually relevant social media posts based on comprehensive market analysis
- **Accelerator Program**: Selected for the lablab.ai AI accelerator program to further develop the product

## Team and Outcome

We formed a team called Trivialis with members including Vito Vekic, Tiago Da Costa, Radek Kargul, Ji Darwish, and Emily Kamperman. After winning the hackathon, we attempted to turn MarkU into a product startup but ultimately concluded the venture after two months of development.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using ChatGPT, LangChain, Generative Agents, Auto-GPT, GPT-4, and GPT-3 to create a comprehensive marketing automation solution that could save businesses time and resources while optimizing their brand's online presence.
