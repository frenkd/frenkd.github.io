# Flood Forecasting using Deep Learning

As part of the ASEF Tutorship Program 2023/24, I worked in the Computer Science tutoring group under prof. dr. Ivan Bratko, focusing on machine learning approaches for predicting extreme weather events. This research was presented at ASEF's first interdisciplinary roundtable on "Opportunities and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence."

## Project Highlights

- Developed machine learning models for predicting extreme weather phenomena
- Focused on data quality assessment methods for training reliable models
- Implemented various validation techniques for the final learning stage
- Researched the impact of data quality on model performance
- Presented findings at ASEF's interdisciplinary roundtable discussion

## Impact

The project contributed to the understanding of machine learning applications in weather forecasting, with a particular emphasis on data quality's crucial role in model reliability. The research highlighted how the quality of input data significantly affects the final models' performance, demonstrating the importance of robust validation methods in weather prediction systems.
