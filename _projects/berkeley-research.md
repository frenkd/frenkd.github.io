# UC Berkeley Research Fellowship

During my time as a Research Fellow at UC Berkeley's Speech & Computation Lab, I worked on developing advanced watermarking techniques for AI-generated speech, addressing one of the key challenges in the era of synthetic media.

## Project Highlights

- Investigated novel approaches to embed imperceptible watermarks in AI-generated speech
- Collaborated with Prof. Gasper Begus and his research team
- Developed models to detect AI-generated content with high accuracy
- Explored the balance between watermark robustness and speech quality
- Presented findings to the lab and ASEF community

## Impact

This research contributes to the field of AI safety and responsible AI deployment, offering tools to help distinguish between human and AI-generated speech content in an increasingly complex media landscape.
