# UC Berkeley Research Fellowship

As an ASEF Fellow 2023, I conducted research at UC Berkeley's Speech & Computation Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Gašper Beguš. The project focused on watermarking AI model outputs, specifically addressing the challenge of detecting and preventing misuse of generative speech models.

## Project Highlights

- Developed techniques for embedding hidden watermarks in AI-generated speech content
- Implemented detection methods that can distinguish between human and AI-generated audio
- Created watermarking systems that maintain audio quality while ensuring detectability
- Explored the growing challenges of synthetic media detection and verification
- Extended the research into my MSc thesis at Utrecht University

## Impact

This research contributes to the critical field of AI safety and responsible AI deployment. As generative AI models become more sophisticated, the ability to verify content authenticity becomes increasingly important. The developed watermarking techniques offer a promising approach to help distinguish between human and AI-generated speech content, potentially helping prevent misuse of generative models.

The project has led to ongoing research that will be expanded in my Master's thesis at Utrecht University, with plans for publication as a conference paper. The work was conducted as part of the ASEF Fellowship program, which facilitates research opportunities at top US institutions for Slovenian students.
