# SEOS AI

SEOS AI is a leading provider of internal AI training and education for Slovenian companies. Starting in 2026, I joined the team as an AI lecturer and consultant, bringing technical depth and hands-on experience to help teams move from "listening" to action.

## What We Do

- Internal AI workshops for companies (ChatGPT, Copilot for Business, and beyond)
- Technical and advanced content for teams that want to implement AI — not just understand it
- Support for architecture, automation, and complex AI workflows
- Practical guidance for teams building reliable AI systems at scale

## My Role

I joined SEOS AI to expand the team's technical capacity and deliver deeper, more hands-on content. My focus is on practical workshops and helping teams understand how to actually deploy AI in their day-to-day work — covering everything from prompt engineering and AI tooling to automation pipelines and system design.
